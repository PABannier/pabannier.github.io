I am a Research Scientist at [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com/), working on computer vision for histopathology. My research spans self-supervised learning, spatial transcriptomics and cutting-edge imaging modalities like imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and immunofluorescence (IF).

I am a core contributor to [skglm](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm), a solver for high-dimensional sparse learning problems and, [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml), a C library for efficient tensor calculus. I have created [bark.cpp](https://github.com/PABannier/bark.cpp), a package to run text-to-speech models on the edge.

Previously, I was an ML researcher at French computer science research institute [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) in the Parietal team, working on sparse neuroimaging models and optimization with [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/) and [Joseph Salmon](https://josephsalmon.eu/).

For my [master thesis](https://pabannier.github.io/assets/pdf/PierreAntoineBannier_master_thesis.pdf), I worked with [Mathurin Massias](https://mathurinm.github.io/) on convex and non-convex non-smooth optimization algorithms.

I hold an MSc in Data Science from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). Before that, I graduated from [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/fr) (management) in France.
